### Hi there 👋, I’m Thijs

- 👀 I’m interested in Business Central, Power Platform, and all things Microsoft!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the latest features and technologies in Business Central software development.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first high-level programming language 1950, Fortran, was written using assembly language.
                This foundational work allowed programmers to write more complex and human-readable code, paving the way for modern software development! 🚀
